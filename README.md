# 🃏 Poker Bankroll Tracker

A CNCF-flavored, self-hosted poker bankroll analytics platform built by a developer, infra operator, ML/SecOps tinkerer — and poker player. Track every chip, spot your tilt, and outplay variance with data. ♠️📈

---

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Track Sessions**: From start to finish, with real-time updates and metrics
- **Live Analytics**: Visualize stack movements and session health in real time
- **AI Insights**: Detect tilt and suggest breaks based on behavior patterns
- **Comprehensive History**: Analyze trends, performance, and patterns over time
- **Offline Resilience**: Continue session tracking with auto-sync on reconnection

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Real-Time Session Tracking
1. User creates session → FastAPI stores in Redis with TTL
2. Session events published to Kafka
3. Frontend receives live updates via SSE
4. AI models monitor behavior for tilt detection
5. Visualizations update live with stack movement

### Historical Analytics
1. ETL jobs process session events via Flink
2. Aggregated metrics are stored in ClickHouse
3. Superset dashboards render embedded in the frontend

---

## 📊 Analytics Strategy

### Live Analytics (Frontend)
- Stack visualization and current metrics
- Behavioral alerts and tilt detection
- Session break suggestions in real time

### Historical Analytics (Superset)
- Bankroll trend analysis over time
- Breakdown by stake, location, or session type
- Frequency and pattern analysis
- Fully customizable dashboards with SQL support
